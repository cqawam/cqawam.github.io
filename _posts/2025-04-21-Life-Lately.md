When life gives you lemons, they say make lemonade. That’s exactly what I’ve been doing for a while now during my break from writing. I’ll skip the sour details and focus on the good lemonade stuff instead.

To say life has been hectic would be an understatement. I’ve been trying to maintain my sanity and stay true to the person I want to become. I’ve made some tough sacrifices, realigned a few priorities, and reset some commitments.

On the brighter side, I picked up Golang, and it's been going well! I’m learning backend development now, and it's reignited my interest in web security. That’s why I’ve decided to revisit the PortSwigger Web Security Academy and go through the labs with a fresh mindset. 

Just wanted to drop a quick update on what I’ve been up to here. Hopefully, I can be consistent now more than ever.
