## A journey of a thousand miles.

Hey! My name is Qawam Musiliu and I'm a security analyst, engineer, and even maybe a researcher (my friend told me, "Fake it till you make it"). 

Secure Scribe is my initiative to document my learning experience, share exciting projects, and interact with the security community. The focus will be on incident response, malware analysis, and detection engineering. I draw the inspiration to begin writing from [Alexandre Borges](https://exploitreversing.com/author/exploitreversing/){:target="_blank"}.
