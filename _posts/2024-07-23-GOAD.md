# Setting Up a Vulnerable Active Directory Environment (GOAD)
As part of my [50-BlueTeam-Projects](https://github.com/cqawam/50-BlueTeam-Projects){:target="\_blank"} and to establish a robust lab environment for Red Team operations and continuous security monitoring, this blog post will guide you through the setup of a vulnerable Active Directory environment known as the [Game of Active Directory (GOAD)](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/GOAD){:target="_blank"} by Orange Cyberdefense.


[Huriye Ã–zdemir](https://l4dybug.medium.com/) has a comprehensive guide on setting up GOAD on a Windows Host using VmWare as a provider. Building on that foundation, this post aims to provide additional insights and practical steps to help you get your GOAD lab up and running efficiently using Oracle Virtualbox as a provider on a Windows host.

## Requirement
- Virtualbox
- Vagrant Virtualbox Utility
- A Linux VM on Virtualbox   

The setup process is in two stages; **Installation** and **Provisioning**.

## Installation
1. **Clone the GOAD Repository:**
    - Begin by cloning the GOAD repository to your local machine using Git.
    ```powershell
       git clone https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/GOAD.git
    ```
    
2. **Navigate to the Desired Lab Directory:**
    - Change to the `ad` directory and then navigate to the specific lab directory you wish to set up.

3. **Run Vagrant Up:**
   - From the virtualbox provider directory, run `vagrant up` to initiate the setup. Vagrant will check for the required Windows box and download it if it's not already available.
   ```powershell
      vagrant up
   ```  
   <div style="text-align: center;">

   </div>

   - The command will bring up the VMs.
