As part of my [50-BlueTeam-Projects](https://github.com/cqawam/50-BlueTeam-Projects){:target="_blank"} and to establish a robust lab environment for Red Team operations and continuous security monitoring, this blog post will guide you through the setup of a vulnerable Active Directory environment known as the [Game of Active Directory (GOAD)](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/GOAD){:target="_blank"} by Orange Cyberdefense.

GOAD is an Active Directory lab project tailored for pentesting. This lab provides a vulnerable Active Directory environment, perfect for practicing common attack techniques. 

**Available Labs** 

- [**GOAD**](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/GOAD/blob/main/ad/GOAD/README.md){:target="_blank"}: 5 vms, 2 forests, 3 domains
- [**GOAD-Light**](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/GOAD/blob/main/ad/GOAD-Light/README.md){:target="_blank"}: 3 vms, 1 forest, 2 domains
- [**MINILAB**](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/GOAD/blob/main/ad/MINILAB/README.md){:target="_blank"}: 2 vms, 1 forst, 1 domain
- [**SCCM**](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/GOAD/blob/main/ad/SCCM/README.md){:target="_blank"}: 4 vms, 1 forest, 1 domain, with Microsoft configuration manager installed
- [**NHA**](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/GOAD/blob/main/ad/SCCM/README.md){:target="_blank"}:  A challenge with 5 vms and 2 domains


## Requirement
- [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads){:target="_blank"}
- [Vagrant](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/install){:target="_blank"}
- A Linux VM on Virtualbox (Ubuntu)  

The setup process is in two stages; **Installation** and **Provisioning**.

## Installation
1. **Clone the GOAD Repository:**
    - Begin by cloning the GOAD repository to your local machine using Git.
    ```powershell
       git clone https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/GOAD.git
    ```
    
2. **Navigate to the Desired Lab Directory:**
    - Change to the `ad` directory and then navigate to the specific lab directory you wish to set up.

3. **Run Vagrant Up:**
   - From the virtualbox provider directory, run `vagrant up` to initiate the setup. Vagrant will check for the required Windows box and download it if it's not already available.
   ```powershell
      vagrant up
   ```  
     
     **Note:** Make sure the IP addresses assigned to the VMs in the vagrant file matches Virtualbox host-only network segment as shown below

     _IP configuration in the vagrant file_

   - The command will bring up the VMs.

## Provisioning
To configure the current setup into a fully vulnerable Active Directory environment, we need to complete the provisioning process. This will be achieved using Ansible on a Linux VM (Ubuntu).

#### Prerequisites:

1. *Create a Python3 virtual environment (v3.8 and above)* 
```bash
    sudo apt install git
    git clone git@github.com:Orange-Cyberdefense/GOAD.git
    cd GOAD/ansible
    sudo apt install python3.10-venv
    python3.10 -m virtualenv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. *Install ansible and pywinrm in the .venv*
```bash
    python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
    python3 -m pip install ansible-core==2.12.6
    python3 -m pip install pywinrm
```

3. *Install all the ansible-galaxy requirements*
```bash
    ansible-galaxy install -r ansible/requirements.yml
```

#### Provisioning with Ansible
1.  *Use the command below to run the ansible playbooks on Virtualbox for the installed lab*
```bash
    cd ansible/
    ansible-playbook -i ../ad/GOAD/data/inventory -i ../ad/GOAD/providers/virtualbox/inventory main.yml
```

    _ansible playbooks run_

    _complete setup_


## Troubleshooting

During the provisioning, I ran into problems with the installation of MSSQL database on `srv02` twice. Reading the error information, I uninstalled all MSSQL components on `srv02` the first time and the folder containing the installation.

I reran the `main.yml` playbook the second time. The new error was peculiar according to the troubleshooting guide for the GOAD project.

I just ran the playbook once more and it was successful.
