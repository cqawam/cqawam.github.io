With a vulnerable Active Directory environment set up, I will proceed to share how to install and configure the ELK Stack as a Security Information and Event Monitoring (SIEM) system. This setup will enable us to centrally collect logs in various formats from endpoints for continuous security monitoring.

As junior security analysts, having a demonstrated understanding of how to identify attack patterns will help you map attackers' tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

This blog post is part of my [50-BlueTeam-Projects](https://github.com/cqawam/50-BlueTeam-Projects){:target="_blank"} and a preamble to the Active Directory Exploitation and Security Monitoring series.

## Installing Elastic Stack
The following steps highlight how to install the Elastic stack with Debian package:  
1. **Import the Elasticsearch PGP Key**
- _Download and install the public signing key:_
```bash
   wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/elasticsearch-keyring.gpg
```  
2. **Installing from the APT repository**
- _Install the apt-transport-https package:_
```bash
   sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
```
- _Save the repository definition to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-8.x.list:_
```bash
   echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/elasticsearch-keyring.gpg] https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/8.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-8.x.list
```

3. Install Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana
```bash
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install elasticsearch logstash kibana
```
Toward the end of the installation, take note of the security information displayed on the terminal. There will be a password generated for the built-in superuser.  

The next section outlines the configuration of each component of the stack

## Configuring Elastic Stack
After successful installation, the first step is to enable the services to start automatically using systemd:
```bash
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch.service
    sudo systemctl enable logstash.service
    sudo systemctl enable kibana.service
```
### Configuring Elasticsearch
1. The configuration is quite easy, locate the config file at `/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml` and configure the `Network Section accordingly`

2. *Check that Elasticsearch is running:*
```bash
   sudo -u elasticsearch curl --cacert /etc/elasticsearch/certs/http_ca.crt -u elastic:$ELASTIC_PASSWORD https://localhost:9200
```

### Configuring Logstash
According to the documentation, Logstash requires one of these versions:
- Java 11
- Java 17 (Default)  

1.  _Install Java 17 using OpenJDK distribution_
```bash
   sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre
```
2. *Test Logstash installation, run the most basic Logstash pipeline.*
```bash
  /usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash -e 'input { stdin { } } output { stdout {} }'
```

Logstash is quite a robust data collection engine. I will write extensively on it in a future blog.


### Configuring Kibana
Kibana is the frontend to the Elastic stack. The Kibana configuration file is located at `/etc/kibana/kibana.yml`.

1. **Edit the Configuration File**
    - Edit the `server.port` and `server.host` according as shown below  

      ![](images/ELK/ELK3.jpg){: width="780" .normal}

2. **Restart the Kibana Service**
```bash
   sudo systemctl restart kibana.service
```
3. **Access Kibana**

    - Navigate to the Kibana address specified in the configuration file. In this example:  
    `hxxp://192[.]168.56.102:5601`
    - Begin the configuration process:  
    
      ![](images/ELK/ELK4.jpg){: width="780" .normal}

4. **Login**
    - After the initial configuration, you will be prompted for a login and password. Use your `elastic` user and the generated password:  

      ![](images/ELK/ELK5.jpg){: width="780" .normal}
 

That completes the setup of the Elastic stack


## Troubleshooting

After the installation I configured the ELK Stack in the same airgapped environment as the machines in the [GOAD](https://cqawam.github.io/posts/GOAD/){:target="_blank"} lab setup.  
Security feature is enable by default when you installed Elasticsearch. To override the default security configuration, I generated a new Certificate Authority and a new HTTPS configuration.   

The guides to the both steps are below:
- [Security Basic Setup](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.14/security-basic-setup.html){:target="_blank"}
- [Basic HTTPs Setup](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.14/security-basic-setup-https.html){:target="_blank"}  

I updated the `elasticsearch.yml` file according as shown below:
