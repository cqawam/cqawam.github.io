Suricata as an open-source network threat detection engine stands out for its versatility and power. Primarily known for its use as an IDS/IPS, Suricata also offers a number of features which include logging capabilities for application layer protocols (TLS/SSL, HTTP, DNS), scripting, pcap recording, and file extraction. 

This blog will guide you through the process of setting up and configuring Suricata for network security monitoring. I’ll cover everything from installation to writing custom rules, testing your setup, and integrating Suricata logs into an ELK SIEM for comprehensive analysis.

## Installation
For Ubuntu, Open Information Security Foundation (OISF) maintains the `suricata-stable` PPA, which is regularly updated with the latest stable release of Suricata.  

1. Setup to install the latest stable Suricata:

```bash
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:oisf/suricata-stable
sudo apt-get update
```
2. Then, you can install the latest stable with:

```bash
sudo apt-get install suricata
```
3. To check the installed version, use the command:
```bash
suricata -V
```
Now, we will proceed to the setup section

## Setup
1. Before proceeding with the setup, get the network interface(s) and IP address(es) on which Suricata should inspect packets  
```bash
ip -br a
```
![](images/SURICATA/sur3.jpg){: width = "855" .normal}

2. With that information, configure Suricata using the `suricata.yaml` config file.
    - **Inform Suricata about your network**  
    The `#HOME_NET:` variable represent the network segment of your LAN while the `#EXTERNAL_NET` is set to any because this is an airgapped environment and traffic will be within the LAN.  
    ![](images/SURICATA/sur4.jpg){: width = "855" .normal}
    
    - **Select outputs to enable**  
     If there is no need to change logging settings, leave as default.
     
    - **Configure common capture settings**  
     Under `af-packet`, specify the interface name of the `#HOME_NET` specified earlier, leave rest as default
    ![](images/SURICATA/sur5.jpg){: width = "855" .normal}
     

This complete the basic configuration for Suricata in IDS runmode. Next up is Signatures (Rules)

## Signatures (Rules)
Suricata signatures, commonly referred to as rules, are used for triggering alerts. It is necessary to keep them updated always. The `suricata-update` tool simplifies the process of fetching, updating, and managing rules for Suricata.  
There are several aspects to rule management, including updating existing rules, incorporating additional rulesets, selecting which rules to activate, and creating custom rules. For this setup, we'll focus on the default configuration, which uses the Emerging Threats (ET) Open ruleset.

```bash
sudo suricata-update
```
To test our configuration in this airgapped environment, I'll demonstrate by creating a simple custom rule to detect ICMP traffic within the network. The following steps outline how to add your own rules:
- Create a file for local rules `local.rules` in any directory
```bash 
cd /var/lib/suricata/rules
sudo touch local.rules
```
- Update the config file to include the `local.rules` file
![](images/SURICATA/sur6.jpg){: width = "855" .normal}

- The custom rule is shown below
```bash
alert icmp $HOME_NET any <> $EXTERNAL_NET any (msg: "ICMP Test Rule"; sid: 1; rev: 1;)
```
- This rule can be triggered quite easy. Start tail to see updates to fast.log and ping any system on the network
```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/suricata/fast.log
```
![](images/SURICATA/sur7.jpg){: width = "855" .normal}
_I had no clue there was an existing rule to match ping (GPL ICMP PING *NIX)_

- Test configuration
```bash
sudo suricata -T
```
The next step in this blog post is to integrate Suricata with our Elastic Stack setup, enabling centralized log management. 




## Integrating Suricata with ELK Stack
To get the best out of Suricata, the next step is to integrate it with our ELK Stack setup. This integration will allow us to centralize and analyze logs from Suricata within Elasticsearch, providing a unified view of network events. By feeding Suricata’s alerts and logs into Kibana, we can visualize and investigate potential threats more efficiently, turning raw data into actionable insights. 

The components for this setup:
- Elasticsearch
- Kibana
- Filebeat
- Suricata

## Filebeat Installation and Configuration
### Installing Filebeat
Using Elastsic APT repositories, we begin the installation of Filebeat with the following:
1. **Add the Beats repository for APT**
    - Download and install the Public Signing Key:
    ```bash
    wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -
    ```
    - Install the apt-transport-https package on Debian:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
    ```
    - Save the repository definition to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-8.x.list:
    ```bash
    echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/8.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-8.x.list
    ```
 
2. **Install with apt-get**
    - Update the repositories and install with apt package manager
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install filebeat
    ```

### Configuring Filebeat
With Filebeat successfully installed, the next step is to configure it and enable the Suricata module. This module will allow us to seamlessly ship Suricata's `eve.json` logs to Elasticsearch, where we can then visualize the data in Kibana. 

1. **Configure Suricata module**
    - The recommended way is to configure modules in the `modules.d` directory. 
    ```bash 
    sudo filebeat modules enable suricata
    ```
    - Then open the `/etc/filebeat/modules.d/suricata.yml` file and set `eve.enable:` to `true`
  
2. **Configure Filebeat** 
    - Open the `filebeat.yml` config file, configure `Kibana output` and `Elastic output` sections accordingly as shown below
    ![](images/SURICATA/sur8.jpg){: width = "855" .normal}
    _Kibana Output_
    ![](images/SURICATA/sur9.jpg){: width = "855" .normal}
    _Elasticsearch Output_
    
    - Save the config file and run the command below to test the configuration. At the end, you get a `Config OK` message
    ```bash
    sudo filebeat test config
    ```
    - Run the command below to load the Winlogbeat's predefined assets for parsing, indexing, and visualizing your data
    ```bash
    sudo filebeat setup -e
    ```
    At the end, you get a `Loaded Ingest pipelines` message
    
   - Start `filebeat.service` with `systemd`
   ```bash
   sudo sysetmctl start filebeat.service
   ```

3. **Visualizing Suricata Data in Kibana**
    - Navigate to the Kibana address and open Dashboards to visualize Suricata data
