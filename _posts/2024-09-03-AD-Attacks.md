Welcome to the **Active Directory Exploitation** sections. These sections are particularly aimed to provide students and junior security specialists with a comprehensive overview of common attack vectors in Active Directory (AD) environments. Through the subsequent posts, you will gain the knowledge and skills necessary to detect, analyze, and mitigate similar attacks within your own networks.

By the end of the sections, and particularly the following sections on **Continuous Security Monitoring**, you will be equipped to leverage the Elastic Stack as a SIEM system effectively.

## Active Directory Attacks Overview
This series will cover the following topics, providing a structured approach to understanding and executing attacks within an Active Directory environment:

- Reconnaissance and User Enumeration
- Poisoning and Relaying
- User Exploitation
- Active Directory Certificate Services Exploitation
- Metasploit Techniques
- MSSQL Exploitation
- Privilege Escalation
- Lateral Movement
- Delegation Abuse
- Access Control Lists (ACL) Exploitation
- Trust Relationship Exploitation

The information presented in this series is drawn from a variety of sources, including technical blogs, training courses, and my own hands-on experience with Active Directory. While this series aims to be informative and practical, it is by no means an exhaustive guide to Active Directory attacks.

**Disclaimer**: The primary purpose of this series is educational. It is intended to deepen my understanding of attack methodologies and enhance my ability to detect such activities. Please use this information responsibly.
