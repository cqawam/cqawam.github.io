As a security analyst, Windows event logs are among the most valuable sources of information for your daily work. Optimizing the logging of critical activities within an Active Directory environment or even a single workstation is crucial. It not only accelerates incident detection but also provides a robust source of evidence in the event of a network intrusion. 

In this blog post, part of the *Active Directory Exploitation and Security Monitoring series*, we'll focus on setting up comprehensive event logging in an Active Directory environment using Group Policy Object (GPO) and ingesting event logs into elasticsearch with Winlogbeat agent. For optimal logging practices, be sure to check out [Microsoft audit recommendation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/security-best-practices/audit-policy-recommendations){:target="_blank"}


## Active Directory Audit Policy with GPO
Group Policy Object (GPO) can be used to centrally applied a comprehensive audit policy in a corporate environment like in our lab setup. Per Microsoft audit guide, we will proceed with the configuration one **DC01 - kingslanding**:

1. Open the Group Policy Object Management Tools
    - Launch the `Group Policy Object Management` and go to **Forest:sevenkingdoms.local** -> **Domains** -> **sevenkingdoms.local** -> **Group Policy Objects** to view existing GPOs

2. Create a new GPOs for Windows event logging
    - Right-click and select New to create a new audit policy to configure the logging
 
3. Configure the Audit Policy
    - After creating the new GPOs, named `Windows Events Logging`, right-click and select **Edit** to open **Group Policy Management Editor**
    ![](images/ADAudit/AD2.jpg){: width = "855" .normal}
    - Go to **Computer Configuration** -> **Policies** -> **Windows Settings** -> **Security Settings** -> **Advanced Audit Policy Configuration** -> **Audit Policies**
    ![](images/ADAudit/AD3.jpg){: width = "855" .normal}  
    
    From here on, configure the audit policy according to [Microsoft audit recommendation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/security-best-practices/audit-policy-recommendations){:target="_blank"} for each subcategory
    
4. Move `Windows Event Logging` policy to  **Forest:sevenkingdoms.local** -> **Domains** -> **sevenkingdoms.local** -> **Domain Controllers** to apply it to **DC01 - kingslanding** and enforce it.

5. Verify audit policy settings
    - From `Run` (Win + R) run `gpupdate`. This pops a shell updating the Group Policy setting
    - Open PowerShell as as Administrator and run `audipol /get /category:*`

GOAD-Light consists of 2 domains, we will replicate the same audit policy on the domain controller, **DC02 - winterfell**, in `north.sevenkingdoms.local` and **SRV02 - castelblack**

## Configuring Sysmon
Sysmon (System Monitor) is part of the [Systernal suite](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/){:target="_blank"}. The default Microsoft Windows logging capability is pretty limited, to enhance for higher level monitoring we will install and configure Sysmon.
To get the best out of Sysmon itself, we will use the popular [Swift On Security](https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config){:target="_blank"} configuration.

1. Download Sysinternal Suites and Swift On Security Configuration
2. Install and configure with the command 

    ```powershell
    sysmon.exe -accepteula -i sysmonconfig-export.xml
    ```

    ![](images/ADAudit/AD6.jpg){: width = "855" .normal} 
    
We will replicate the same process on the machines in `north.sevenkingdoms.local` domain; **DC02 - winterfell** and **SRV02 - castelblack**


## Windows Event Logs and Winlogbeat
Winlogbeat is installed as a service on a Windows system and serves as a lightweight shipper for sending Windows event logs to Elasticsearch. In this section, I will guide you through the installation and configuration of Winlogbeat within an Active Directory environment.  

1. **Install Winlogbeat**
   - Download the Winlogbeat zip file from the downloads page.
   - Extract the contents into C:\Program Files.
   - Rename the winlogbeat-<version> directory to Winlogbeat.
   - Open a PowerShell prompt as an Administrator (right-click on the PowerShell icon and select Run As Administrator).
   - From the PowerShell prompt, run the following commands to install the service.
   ```powershell
    Get-ExecutionPolicy
    PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy UnRestricted -File .\install-service-winlogbeat.ps1
   ```

2. **Connect to the Elastic Stack**  
    - In order to setup Winlogbeat, we need to connect to Elasticsearch and Kibana. Open the configuration file `winlogbeat.yml` in a text editor and edit the `Elasticsearch` and `kibana` sections 
    ![](images/ADAudit/AD8.jpg){: width = "855" .normal}
    
3. **Configure Winlogbeat**
    - Under the Winlogbeat specific option, highlight the list of events logs to be monitored. 
    ```powershell
    Get-WinEvent -ListLog * | Measure-Object -Line
    ```
    The command above returns a total of 410 logs in my case, which is way too much than required. From a security standpoint, we will be interested in the following event logs; *Application*, *System*, *Security*, *Windows PowerShell*, *Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational*, *Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational*, and *Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity/Operational*
    
    ![](images/ADAudit/AD9.jpg){: width = "855" .normal}
    
    - Save the `winlogbeat.yml` config file and run the command below to test the configuration. At the end, you get a `Config OK` message
    ```powershell
    .\winlogbeat.exe test config -c .\winlogbeat.yml -e
   ```
 
4. **Set up Asset**
    - Run the command below to load the Winlogbeat's predefined assets for parsing, indexing, and visualizing your data
    ```powershell
    .\winlogbeat.exe setup -e
    ```
    At the end, you get a `Loaded Ingest pipelines` message
    
5. **Start Winlogbeat**
    - Get Winlogbeat running with the command:
    ```powershell
    Start-Service winlogbeat
    ```
    - You can manage the `winlogbeat` service with Windows `service.msc`
    
6. **Visualize data in Kibana**
    - Navigate to the Kibana page `http://192[.]168.56.102`
    - Open **Discover** from the side navigation and voila!

## Troubleshooting
While setting Winlogbeat client configuration options in the `output.elastic` section, I encountered some issues with the `ssl` settings. In the previous article's troubleshooting section, I generated a new CA `elastic-stack-ca.p12` and certificate/key `elasticsearch-certificates.p12` for Elasticsearch security settings.

The PKCS#12 certificate could not be used in Winlogbeat. So, I converted the PKCS#12 certificate to PEM certificate and private key pairs with the command below:


```bash
openssl pkcs12 -in path.p12 -out newfile.crt.pem -clcerts -nokeys --passin 'pass:<password-here>'
openssl pkcs12 -in path.p12 -out newfile.key.pem -nocerts -nodes --passin 'pass:<password-here>'
```
Then I used the `newfile.crt.pem` and `newfile.key.pem` in the Winlogbeat config file.
